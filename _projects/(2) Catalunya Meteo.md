**Catalunya Meteo** was an Android application focused on providing real-time meteorological data
and weather forecasts for Catalonia, including radar, lightning activity, temperature maps, and
mountain-specific forecasts.

The project started in 2016 as a collaboration with
<a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/alejandrorosasdev" target="_blank">Alejandro Rosas</a>, and served
as an early exploration of mobile development, data aggregation, and external API integration.

From a technical perspective, the application relied on a lightweight backend layer with caching to
aggregate and normalize data from multiple public meteorological sources (such as AEMET, Meteocat,
and Meteoclimatic), reducing network usage and improving response times on mobile devices.

The project is no longer actively maintained and was discontinued in late 2024. It is presented
here as an **archived project**, representing early hands-on experience with Android development,
data-driven applications, and backend-supported mobile architectures.
