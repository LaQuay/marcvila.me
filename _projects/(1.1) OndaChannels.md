**OndaChannels** is a community-driven platform focused exclusively on discovering and listening to
Spanish radio streams online, legally and for free.

While it shares the same core principles as **TDTChannels** — legality, simplicity, and openness —
OndaChannels is designed around a radio-first experience, optimized for continuous listening,
background playback, and quick access to live stations.

## Platform

OndaChannels is available both as a web application and as a **native Android app**, providing a
consistent experience across desktop, mobile devices, and Android TV.

The platform prioritizes fast startup times, low resource usage, and a clean interface tailored
specifically to radio consumption, rather than video-centric use cases.

## Shared Architecture

From a technical perspective, OndaChannels is built on the same underlying architecture as
TDTChannels, reusing the existing data pipeline, validation processes, and backend services.

This shared foundation allows both platforms to evolve independently at the product level while
maintaining a single, well-tested core for data curation, distribution, and client integration.
