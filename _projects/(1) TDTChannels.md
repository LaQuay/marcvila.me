Your online TV and Radio platform to watch online, free-to-air broadcasts, legally and totally free!
<br><br>
The project was born in 2018, when I understood the need to offer the population the possibility of
watching television on the Internet, with as many channels as possible, for free, and always
legally. <br>
The project has as a source an <a href="https://github.com/LaQuay/TDTChannels" target="_blank">open
source database</a> published in GitHub, where people can contribute new links, and I validate them
before publishing.

## Website

In order to be able to reproduce these collected links, I developed a website in React JS, which
also includes HTML and CSS concepts. The website is closed source, but as it is client side, you can
always check the code in your browser.

## Android App

As with the website, I developed an Android application for viewing the channels. This application
besides reading the channels linked in the main list, is able to get more channels to play legally,
through a search engine made specifically. It is made with native Android. And it is also closed
source. Although initially it was open source, you can still see the latest <a
