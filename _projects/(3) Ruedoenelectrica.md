---

This is a project that aims to open up electric mobility to citizens. Specifically in the field of
motorcycles and light vehicles. To this end, the project consists of a website, a blog and more than
20 Telegram groups, all done by ourselves.

Started at the end of 2019, together with David Vicente, a member of <a
href="http://asovel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">ASOVEL</a>.

The whole project is running Dockerized on a server. And for the Telegram, we have out custom BOT,
also running Dockerized.
