**Ruedoeneléctrica** is a Spanish-speaking community and content platform focused on electric
mobility, with a particular emphasis on electric motorcycles and light vehicles.

The project aims to make electric mobility more accessible by combining editorial content with
community-driven discussion spaces. It is currently active through a public WordPress site and a
large Telegram-based community.

The initiative started in late 2019 together with David Vicente, a member of
<a href="http://asovel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">ASOVEL</a>, as an attempt to centralize
information and discussion around electric two-wheel mobility in Spain.

## Community Evolution

During its early stages, the project included a self-hosted discussion forum, which was actively
operated for approximately one year. Based on usage patterns and community behavior, the forum was
later discontinued in favor of platforms that better matched how users interacted and communicated.

Today, the core of the community lives on **Telegram**, where it is organized into around **50
topic-specific groups**, bringing together **more than 3,000 users** across Spain.

## Web & Content Platform

Ruedoeneléctrica maintains an editorial website built on **WordPress**, where news, articles, and
updates related to electric mobility are published.

The website is freely accessible at
<a href="https://www.ruedoenelectrica.com/" target="_blank">www.ruedoenelectrica.com</a> and serves as
the public-facing hub for the project, complementing the more conversational nature of the Telegram
community.

## Infrastructure

From a technical standpoint, the project has been fully self-hosted and containerized, with both
web services and custom Telegram tooling running in Docker-based environments.

To support community management and moderation at scale, a custom Telegram bot was implemented
using the Python Telegram Bot library, enabling automation and operational tooling across the
different Telegram groups.
