description: Selected open source contributions, mainly focused on improving documentation and developer experience.
---

I regularly contribute to open source projects by improving documentation and clarifying usage,
configuration, or architectural details. These contributions are usually driven by real-world
usage, where missing or unclear documentation becomes a friction point.

Rather than focusing on feature development, my contributions aim to improve **developer
experience**, onboarding, and long-term maintainability of existing projects.
