    <p>
        Between 2016 and 2020 I actively participated in multiple international hackathons.
        I keep this section as a snapshot of that period and as evidence of my hands-on,
        product-driven technical background.

        Below is a curated list of the hackathons I took part in, including awarded projects
        and the technologies used.
