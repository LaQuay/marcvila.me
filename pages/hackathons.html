A hackathon <i>(hack day, hackfest, datathon, codefest, or hacking marathon)</i> is a design sprint-like
<b>event</b>; in which <b>computer programmers and others</b> involved in software development, including graphic
designers, interface designers, project managers, domain experts, and others <b>collaborate 
intensively on software projects</b>.
</br></br>
The <b>goal</b> is to <b>create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event</b>. 
They tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the 
operating system, an application, an API, a framework to be tested, ... . In other cases, there 
is no restriction on the type of software being created.

Below is a list of the ones I have done so far. Cards are ordered from top to bottom and left
to right.
