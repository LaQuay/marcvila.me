    A hackathon <i>(hacking marathon, hack day, hack/codefest, or datathon)</i> is a design
    sprint-like <b>event</b>; in which <b>computer programmers</b>, graphic designers, interface
    designers, domain experts, and others <b>collaborate intensively on computer science 
    projects</b>.
    </br></br>
    The <b>goal</b> is to <b>create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event</b>. 
    Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the 
    operating system, an API or framework to be tested, ... . Although in some cases there are no 
    restrictions.

    Below is a list of the ones I have done so far. Cards are ordered from top to bottom and left 
    to right.
