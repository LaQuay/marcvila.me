<h2 class="mb-3">Research Topic</h2>

<b>In short</b>: Monitoring physical infrastructures using Internet of Things devices, Semantics and
Microservices Architectures.

The aim of the research, within the framework of the industrial doctorate I am doing, is to <b>cover
from start to finish what can be accomplished based on the reading of an IoT sensor</b>. With these
data, be able to <b>obtain the information</b> embedded in it, <b>monitor it</b>, and be able to
<b>act if necessary</b>.

Part of the work within this research will be to find a way to <b>generalize or homogenise or the
data input</b> format from the sensors to the system, adding <b>semantics and ontologies</b> to it.
To provide it with a <b>common data input format for the entire IoT ecosystem</b>, and to propose
alternatives for the academic world in general.

In addition, research to deploy the whole environment under <b>microservices architecture</b>. It
mainly contributes to having each functionality separated by different modules. In short, it means
improved fault isolation, simplicity in understanding the system, technology flexibility, faster
technical deployments, and more easily scalable.
