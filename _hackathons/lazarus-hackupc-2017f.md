### The solution

Lazarus, a mobile application for Android that helps blind or visually impaired people to move
around the city and perform simple tasks of daily life without the face-to-face help of a caregiver,
family member or friend using only basic tools such as geolocation, voice recognition or the camera.

Lazarus has two types of users:

- Blind users: people who need help in situations of confusion (like getting lost in a public space)
  or emergency (read a warning text, for example).

- Helper users: volunteers willing to “lend” their eyes to those who can not see. Its function is to
  answer the questions of blind people by transcribing texts or describing images

#### What can the app do for blind people?

Lazarus has 5 basic options that can be used manually or with simple voice instructions.

1. Location: A lost user can instantly know where he is thanks to simplified maps, specially designed for people with visual disabilities, and GPS.

2. Close to me: This option indicates relevant spaces that are around the user in an area of ​​500 meters as: pharmacies, banks, post offices, supermarkets or coffee shops.

3. Look for me: This option allows the user to ask other people what is happening around him eg in situations of confusion or danger (knowing if a food is in a good condition or some pills without a box are the ones he have to take). The user only has to take a photograph and thanks to the help of volunteer users, will solve his doubts.

4. Read text: Lazarus automatically translates written texts into voice messages through an OCR process.

5. Describe object: Lazarus can recognize objects from the real-world in order to help you with your daily issues.
