### The solution

Have you ever visited the doctor while feeling sick? It is known that it won't last the time we
would expect, the doctor is going to prescribe some medication that will probably look like a 
hieroglyph which we won't able to understand.

We will be forced to go to the pharmacy to buy a treatment that will probably be sold out or not 
in stock.

These are some of the reasons from where AssistMed comes from. The idea that patient's experience 
should be as easy as talking to a friend is.

AssistMed has two different approaches:

- Creates a bot for Cisco Spark Chat that adds 4 health-related features. Using it, doctors can
prescribe medication to its patients and automatically set reminders through the chat. 
Moreover, doctors/secretaries can organise visits and medical events for organize patients agenda 
and also automatically remind them when the event is near. This for options are easy usable for 
non technical users because they resemble natural language.

- A user-friendly android mobile application that integrates with Cisco Spark Chat by providing
a chat and a videoconference in real time between patient and his/her doctor.

We created a board using Cisco Spark to reproduce a hospital with professionals and patients.
In it we created a bot named HealthAssistBot that will be the link between both type of people.

When the professional needs to create a new event for the patient, he ask the bot to create that 
event and a reminder for the patient. Then, when the date of the event is close to the present, 
the bot will send a message with the information of the event.

Also, the videoconferences are built using the Cisco Spark Meetings to connect the patient with a professional.
