# Team Thor – Carnet Hackathon 2017

March 2017 - Barcelona (Spain)

### The hackathon

Original description from the organizers, [Carnet Barcelona](http://www.carnetbarcelona.com/index.php/2017/03/30/hackathon-mobility-barcelona-2017/):

> ... Student teams enjoyed the opportunity to prove themselves and showcase their wide range of abilities.
> This Hackathon was not only a great learning and networking experience, but also an opportunity to help
> actively define the future of mobility and create a lasting impact.

> Hacking starts at 10:00 AM on Saturday and end at 14:00 AM on Sunday.

### The solution

An user from outside of Barcelona wants to go from A to B. The plan is to calculate where the user will park
its car in a micro city when reaching Barcelona, and then it calculates the public transport the he will need
to use to reach the point B.

An App is used to help the user finding those Micro Cities and the services inside it. If the user uses those
services, he’s rewarded with discounts.
