# WHERE I GO? – HackUPC Fall 2016

November 2016 - Barcelona (Spain)

### The hackathon

Original description from the organizers [HackUPC at Devpost](https://hackupc2016.devpost.com/):

> Over 400 students from over 20 countries will gather for 36h of dreaming, hacking and shipping on
> anything and everything. All projects are welcome, mobile, hardware, web, you name it. ...

> Hacking starts at 12:00 AM on Saturday and ends at 12:00 PM on Sunday.

### The solution

Where I go will help you taking decisions about your next flight corresponding to your weather preferences.
It is an Android application that uses the SkyScanner API, to get the available flights and combine this
data with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide the weather information about your next destination.
