# McTrack – HackPrague 2017

June 2017 - Prague (Czech Republic)

### The hackathon

Original description from the organizers, [HackPrague 2017](https://hackprague-2017.devpost.com/):

> ... For 36 hours, HackPrague will bring together 150 passionate developers and designers from
> across Europe to create cool software and hardware projects. {...} judges from companies like
> Facebook, Google, Avast, and more. You will have the opportunity to interact directly with these
> companies in exchanging ideas, seeking mentorship, or impressing them with your projects.

> Hacking starts at 09:00 AM on Saturday and ends at 18:00 PM on Sunday.

### The solution

Do you ask yourself anytime how could you send a location to your friend when you are inside a
building?
Or maybe you are an employer and asked in your professional world, how can you know how much time
spends a client in each section of your shop?

The idea is that having a router / access point you are able to know who is near you. Without any
interaction with the clients, you will be able to track them. And maybe you want to share personalized
ads to them.
