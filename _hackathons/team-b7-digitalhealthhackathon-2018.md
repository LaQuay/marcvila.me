### The hackathon – Digital Health Hackathon 2018

June 2018 - Barcelona (Spain)

> ... Desarrollar el primer algoritmo que permita predecir la probabilidad de que pacientes con
> cáncer desarrollen una infección por una bacteria resistente a los antibióticos convencionales es
> el objetivo del primer "Hackathon", que este fin de semana celebrará el Hospital Clínic de
> Barcelona.

> Hacking starts at 10:00 AM on Saturday and ends at 15:00 PM on Sunday.

### The challenge

Help our doctors! Develop a Machine Learning algorithm to predict which patients with neutropenia
are most likely to develop multi-drug resistant bacteremia. The ability to produce accurate
data-based predictions, think out of the box, and be a team player will play an essential role to
win this challenge. Not to mention your ability to present to the audience and committee of experts
your insights and outputs generated.

### The solution

Hematological patients face a daily threat. Due to certain cancer treatments, their immune system
deteriorates and many of them likely end up suffering from febrile neutropenia. When this happens,
there is a considerable risk that they end up developing a possibly-fatal disease called bacteremia.
Since performing a complete diagnosis to determine whether a patient has bacteremia or not could
take multiple days (and prolonged waiting times for infected patients would drastically increase
their risk of dying), most patients are treated with broad-spectrum, toxic, and/or expensive
antibiotics right away even if they might not need it. There is, however, a huge amount of
historical data available regarding the tests performed on each patient as well as their
surroundings that could help predict the probability of a patient developing multi-drug resistant
bacteremia.
