# IonicFIB – HackUPC Winter 2017
March 2017

### The hackathon
Official description from [DevPost](https://hackupc2017w.devpost.com/):
> Over 500 students from over 20 countries will gather for 36h of dreaming, hacking and shipping on 
anything and everything. All projects are welcome, mobile, hardware, web, you name it. ...

> Hacking starts at 09:00 PM on Saturday and end at 09:00 PM on Sunday.

### The solution
Ionic FIB is an application made with the Ionic v2 Framework. And as a result, it gives an Android 
compatible application. As it is a webapp, it also can be executed on Web.

The main goal of this app is to check the new FIB API v2. Accessing both sides of it. The public 
part and the private part, which requires an OAuth authentication.

- Authenticating with OAuth v2.
- Shows the user day planning.
- Shows the user alerts.
- Calendar which gives the opportunity to the user to select the subjects that he wants to study 
the current academic year. The algorithm reports the user one of the bests combinations. Combination
based in: less overlap, less 'dead hours', ... .
